# GUI_API_DATABASE
production of internal api

___HOW TO USE___

create an environment (I use conda and mine is called env.con)
install the requirements (remember to make sure they are installed in the correct environment)
run fastapi_main
in terminal type the following, while replacing with your own specifics: /Users/jonsztukslotved/anaconda3/envs/env/bin/python -m uvicorn fastapi_main:app --reload --port 8001 
now your local API should be running
